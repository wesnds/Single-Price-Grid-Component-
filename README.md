## Frontend Mentor - Single Price Grip Component

### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help improves my coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page from the designs provided in the starter code.

It can be used any tools to help complete the challenge. So if we've got something we'd like to practice, we are free to give it a go

The users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that will be need to use the best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

To find all the required assets go to `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information such as color palette and fonts.
